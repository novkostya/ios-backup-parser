# ios-backup-parser — progress & decisions

Milestone tracker and decisions log. One milestone per session (see `CLAUDE.md` →
Process). This file is **public and privacy-gated**: it records *what* was decided
and the state of each milestone, never *where* work runs — Operator-private
infrastructure lives outside this repo.

## Milestone states

| Milestone | Scope | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M0** | Schema spike — document the real schemas of the five domains (docs-only) | **Complete** — five domain docs authored (uncommitted); fingerprints `observed` |
| M1 | Core + `contacts` — `BackupFS`, introspection helpers, capability report | Pending |
| M2 | `calls` (`CallHistory.storedata`) | Pending |
| M3 | `messages` — chats / messages / attachments join, typedstream text | Pending |
| M4 | `calendar` (`Calendar.sqlitedb`) | Pending |
| M5 | `notes` (`NoteStore.sqlite`) — locked notes reported, not decrypted | Pending |
| M6 | v0.1 — docs, examples, schema-coverage table, tag | Pending |

## M0 — schema spike (complete)

**Goal.** Against the Operator-local decrypted study backup (with iLEAPP as
cross-reference), document the *actual* schema of each of the five domains for the
one iOS version present, as scrubbed `docs/schemas/<domain>.md` (structure, never
data). Docs-only milestone: zero Go, no `go.mod`, no `tools/` — schema dumps run via
sqlite3 in a pinned toolchain container; any throwaway script lives in session
scratch and dies there.

**Definition of done** (per the 2026-07-20 rulings — see decisions log):

- One baseline **fingerprint per domain** (single-version honesty), documented in a
  per-fingerprint structure so a later-observed version *appends* rather than forces
  a rewrite. Fingerprints from versions we haven't observed are never invented.
- **Every timestamp column** records its epoch + unit (Cocoa-2001 seconds,
  iMessage-2001 *nanoseconds*, Unix, …) — the off-by-31-years / off-by-10⁹ trap is
  the wrong-but-plausible failure this library exists to prevent.
- **Every domain doc names its storage idiom** — plain app SQLite vs CoreData
  (`Z`-tables, `Z_PK`/`Z_ENT` indirection) vs blob-encoded (typedstream,
  gzip+protobuf) — so M2–M5 inherit the join/PK/epoch strategy.
- The **notes** doc keeps the two note wrinkles separate: (a) per-note password
  protection (out of scope, reported-only) vs (b) the routine gzip+protobuf encoding
  of every ordinary note body (in scope — must be decoded or no note has text).
- **Attachment/media reference shape** recorded per domain (structured
  `FileRef{Domain, RelativePath}`, not a bare path).
- **Capability-report design validated against reality**: for each domain, the fields
  the output model wants vs what the observed schema can actually provide — proving
  the `Capability{Domain, Supported, Schema, Missing}` mechanism (esp. `Missing[]`)
  is real and sufficient.

**Current state — spike complete (uncommitted).** The dedicated dev environment is
provisioned; the corrected study backup (ios-backup-crypt v0.1.1, which restored the
content databases) was introspected **read-only, from scratch copies** — originals
never opened. All five domains are documented in [docs/schemas/](schemas/): storage
idiom, tables, joins, per-column timestamp epoch/unit, domain wrinkles, and a
capability mapping each — plus a cross-domain [schema index](schemas/README.md) and a
`NOTICE` recording the iLEAPP (MIT) cross-reference. Every fingerprint is at status
`observed` (real-backup structure confirmed; no parser exists yet; the differential is
the manual gate to reach `validated`). Deliverables are authored but **not
committed** — commit is Operator-gated and runs `make privacy-check` first.

## Decisions log

Append-only. Adjudicated canon carries a date; in-milestone gap-decisions cite the
milestone (per the Process gap rule). Charter rulings are cross-referenced here, not
restated in full.

- **2026-07-20 — M0 onboarding review adjudicated.** The charter absorbed the review
  outcomes (all marked "ruled 2026-07-20" in `CLAUDE.md`): `Materialize` returns a
  mutation-safe scratch copy and never hands out a path into the original backup;
  never-mutate-input is a hard rule; validation is eager (schema check +
  `ErrUnsupportedSchema` at open) with row-scoped vs stream-scoped iterator errors
  kept distinct; attachments surface as a structured `FileRef`; **fingerprint
  identity is the introspected structure**, and the `Schema` label is a
  discovery-order ordinal (`sms.1`, …), never a version-shaped name; per-column
  timestamp epoch+unit and per-domain storage idiom are required M0 outputs;
  single-version honesty defines M0-done; the license rule's operational form routes
  oracle disagreements through write-ups / format docs / own instrumented dumps —
  never the GPL source; the privacy gate sees staged *content* only (commit-message
  and branch-name hygiene are manual; diff-header matching is intentional); the two
  notes wrinkles stay separate; M0 is docs-only.
- **2026-07-20 — one project, one dev host.** After a shared-box contention incident,
  each sibling library runs its gates on its own dedicated dev host; another project's
  box is never used. ios-backup-parser is provisioned its own at M0 go. (Host
  identity and provisioning are Operator-private, outside this repo.)
- **2026-07-20 — M0 paused: study input lacks the content databases (routed
  upstream).** The dedicated dev environment was provisioned and the decrypted study
  backup mounted read-only, but the tree contains none of the five domains' primary
  databases (`AddressBook.sqlitedb`, `CallHistory.storedata`, `sms.db`,
  `Calendar.sqlitedb`, `NoteStore.sqlite`) — nor Photos/Health/Safari content stores —
  while class-None files (app caches, thumbnails, media, preference plists) are
  present. The absence tracks iOS Data Protection class, i.e. the input's
  higher-protection-class files were not decrypted/reconstructed. Verified read-only
  and tree-wide (exact-name + by-extension); no database content was read (there was
  none). M0 cannot proceed without inventing schemas, which the honesty rules forbid,
  so it is **paused** and the gap is **routed to `ios-backup-crypt`** for a corrected
  study tree. No repo behavior changed; nothing committed.
- **2026-07-20 — M0 unblocked and completed.** `ios-backup-crypt` v0.1.1 fixed the
  real cause (live DBs captured mid-write during Wi-Fi backup: size-aware PKCS#7
  padding strip + lossless partial extraction), restoring all content databases; the
  corrected tree was introspected. Five domain schemas documented, all fingerprints
  `observed`. Storage idioms confirmed — plain SQLite: contacts, messages, calendar;
  CoreData: calls, notes; blob payloads: messages (typedstream `attributedBody`),
  notes (gzip+protobuf `ZDATA`). **Timestamp epochs verified per column: all Cocoa
  2001, but `messages` is in NANOseconds while the other four are seconds** — the
  cross-domain unit trap, now documented. Notes: the locked-note report path is
  documented from the schema and **awaiting differential validation** (needs a backup
  that exercises a locked note) — recorded as designed-not-validated, not asserted
  from data.
  Messages interpretations cross-referenced against iLEAPP `sms.py` (MIT, attributed
  in `NOTICE`); imessage-exporter (GPL) untouched. The `Capability{Domain, Supported,
  Schema, Missing}` shape was validated against all five observed schemas — it holds;
  no change proposed.
- **Forward note (M1, not an M0 decision).** Whether `Missing[]` should also express
  "present-but-partial / capability-gated" (e.g. typedstream rich runs, tapbacks,
  edits) versus only "column absent in this fingerprint" is an API-design question for
  M1 (M0 designs no API). Recorded for M1; not proposed here.
